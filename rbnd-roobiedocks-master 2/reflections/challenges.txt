I don't have any challenges to becoming a Ruby Developer, since that's my current occupation. Right now, though, I struggle with two things: first, finding ways I can support others to becoming developers; second, finding ways to challenge myself as a developer. I hope that becoming a Udacity Code Reviewer can help with the first of these challenges â€” and maybe, as time goes on, it might help with the second as well.
