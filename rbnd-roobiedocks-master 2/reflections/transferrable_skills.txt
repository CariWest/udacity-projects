I have a degree in Creative Writing & Environmental Studies from Emory University. I worked in Customer Service & Administration for a few years before I made the switch to becomming a Software Developer.

From my degrees, I learned many valuable skills such as clear writing and the ability to study. From years in Customer Service & Administration, I bring an eye for detail and the ability to see the product from the user's perspective. I strongly value creating a product which works well and is clear & easy to use, because that makes everyones' lives easier.
